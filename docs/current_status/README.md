## Quick Reference

### I need to...

- **Get the project running** → Start with [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)
- **Understand why we chose Bun** → Read [architecture.md](./architecture.md) or [tech.md](./tech.md)
- **See what's implemented** → Check [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md)
- **Find where files are located** → Reference [project-structure.md](./project-structure.md)
- **Make API calls** → See examples in [api-design.md](./api-design.md)

## Maintenance Guidelines

These documents should be updated whenever:

1. **New features are completed** → Update STATUS.md
2. **Architecture changes** → Update architecture.md and tech.md
3. **File structure changes** → Update project-structure.md
4. **New API endpoints added** → Update api-design.md
5. **Development commands change** → Update development.md

**Keep these docs in sync with the code!** They represent the source of truth for what's currently implemented.
